Very early stages. Currently, data structure is **mostly** built, but I'm pretty sure I've made errors in it for the time being.

To demonstrate adding entries, go to LN#100 of Organizer.py and enter a reminder. TODO: add a handler for this.
Reminder needs to match expected json format currently. ('Title String', datetime(Yr, Mn, Dy, Hr, Mn), datetime (Yr, Mn, Dy, Hr, Mn)) minimum. Name, Start time, End Time.

This section is badly written - go back and do it again, actually write a handler for event ingestion.
